  \nSeeking to understand and transform the world\u2019s energy systems, MIT researchers\
  \ and students investigate all aspects of energy. They discover new ways of generating\
  \ and storing energy, as in creating biofuels from plant waste and in holding electricity\
  \ from renewable sources in cost-effective, high-capacity batteries. They create\
  \ models and design experiments to determine how we can improve energy efficiency\
  \ at all scales, from nanostructures and photovoltaic cells to large power plants\
  \ and smart electrical grids. They analyze how people make decisions about energy,\
  \ whether as individual consumers or whole nations, and they forecast what the social\
  \ and environmental consequences of these decisions might be.\n\nIn fact, the study\
  \ of energy is so important and so pervasive at MIT, the [MIT Energy Initiative](http://energy.mit.edu/)\
  \ has devised an undergraduate\_[Energy Studies Minor](http://energy.mit.edu/minor/)\_\
  which\_develops the expertise needed to reshape how the world uses energy. The heart\
  \ of the Energy Students Minor is a\_[core](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/energy-courses/#EnergyMinorCoreCourses)\_\
  of foundational subjects in\_energy science, technology, and social science, complemented\
  \ by a program of\_[electives](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/energy-courses/#EnergyMinorElectiveCourses)\_\
  which allow students to tailor their Energy Minor to\_their particular interests.\n\
  \nMany of the Energy Minor subjects are represented on OCW, and listed below. In\
  \ addition to the core and elective courses, some\_[other energy courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/energy-courses/#OtherEnergyCourses)\_\
  which are not officially part of the Energy Minor program are also listed."
