description: "### **The MIT Open Learning Library is home to selected educational\
  \ content from MIT OpenCourseWare and MITx courses, available for free to anyone\
  \ in the world at any time.**\n\nMIT is committed to sharing learning materials\
  \ with the world. The Open Learning Library provides additional opportunities to\
  \ learn from MIT at your own pace, engaging with interactive problems and receiving\
  \ instant feedback.\n\n### **Interactive Assessments and Progress Tracking**\n\n\
  One advantage to using the MIT Open Learning Library (OLL) is that, by creating\
  \ a free account, you will be able to keep track of your progress as you work your\
  \ way through a course and to see the answers you\u2019ve submitted to problems\
  \ within the course \u2013 just as you can with [MITx on edX](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx)\
  \ courses. However,\_Open Learning Library does not include discussion forums, certificates,\
  \ or the ability to transfer your progress to MITx on edX.\_\n\nOpen Learning Library\
  \ resources designated as OCW content are free to download, remix, and reuse for\
  \ non-commercial purposes.\_ Resources designated as MITx content have varying licenses:\
  \ some are All Rights Reserved, others Creative Commons, and some have mixed licenses.\
  \ You will see the license type indicated on the About Pages.\n\n### **How MIT Open\
  \ Learning Library Differs from MIT OpenCourseWare and MITx on edX**\n\nYou can\
  \ think of OCW, MITx, and Open Learning Library along a spectrum of learning scenarios,\
  \ in which MIT content is presented in different formats to meet different user\
  \ needs.\_\n\n- **MITx courses on edX** are end-to-end course experiences with optional\
  \ certificates available for you to earn, live teaching support and interaction\
  \ with other learners in discussion forums, and start and end dates.\n- **MIT OpenCourseWare**\
  \ offers a completely self-guided experience with published content from MIT courses\
  \ that is open all of the time and licensed for download, remix, and reuse, but\
  \ does not offer certificates nor interaction with teachers and learners.\_\n- **MIT\
  \ Open Learning Library** sits in between MITx on edX and OCW. As in many MITx courses,\
  \ Open Learning Library provides interactive course experiences that include auto-graded\
  \ assessments that give you instant feedback and allow you to track your progress\
  \ as you work your way through the subject matter. Like OCW, this content is always\
  \ open and self-guided and includes no live support, discussion forum, or certificates."
