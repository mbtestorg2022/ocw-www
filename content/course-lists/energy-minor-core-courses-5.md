description: "The [MIT Energy Initiative](http://energy.mit.edu/) has devised an undergraduate\_\
  [Energy Studies Minor](http://energy.mit.edu/minor/)\_which\_develops the expertise\
  \ needed to reshape how the world uses energy. The heart of the Energy Students\
  \ Minor is a\_[core](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/energy-courses/#EnergyMinorCoreCourses)\_\
  of foundational subjects in\_energy science, technology, and social science, complemented\
  \ by a program of\_[electives](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/energy-courses/#EnergyMinorElectiveCourses)\_\
  which allow students to tailor their Energy Minor to\_their particular interests."
