description: "Massachusetts Institute of Technology has always been associated with\
  \ major scientific and technological breakthroughs. But the breakthroughs alone\
  \ do not explain the impact that MIT has had on the world. For that we have to look\
  \ at entrepreneurship, which starts with the \"Mens et Manus\" (Mind and Hand) slogan\
  \ on the Great Seal of MIT. For faculty, students, and alumni, MIT is all about\
  \ making discoveries and inventions and then applying these discoveries and inventions\
  \ to solve real problems. In a very tangible way, MIT faculty and graduates invent\
  \ the future, and entrepreneurship\u2014the building of new businesses\u2014is often\
  \ the road to that future.\n\n![Title screen from the video, 'The Ecosystem: Nurturing\
  \ Entrepreneurship at MIT'.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/entrepreneurship/ecosystem_slate2.png)\_\
  \  \n[Watch this video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkDqpBctfA)\
  \ to entrepreneurship at MIT.\n\nThe report \u201C[Entrepreneurship and Innovation\
  \ at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/innovate/entrepreneurship2015.pdf)\u201D examines the\
  \ impact of MIT graduates who have founded and built for-profit companies. The report\
  \ estimates that, as of 2014, living MIT alumni have launched more than 30,000 active\
  \ companies, creating some 4.6 million jobs and generating $1.9 trillion in annual\
  \ revenue. The cumulative result is the equivalent of the 10th largest economy in\
  \ the world. This rich legacy of high-impact companies spans a wide range of industries;\
  \ recent examples include A123 Systems, Akamai, iRobot, InVivo Therapeutics and\
  \ Dropbox.\n\nThe following courses represent a selection of \"core\" entrepreneurship-related\
  \ courses offered at MIT."
