description: "Like so many of the big challenges taken on at MIT, environmental and\
  \ sustainability issues demand an interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nFrom declining\
  \ fisheries to acute urban pollution to record-breaking global temperatures, the\
  \ evidence of human impact on the environment continues to mount. And at the same\
  \ time, the environment shapes us, as human society and institutions are built upon\
  \ our connection to the weather, land, water, and other species. What can we learn\
  \ from ecological systems and cycles? What are the right solutions to our urgent\
  \ environmental challenges?\n\nMIT scholars, students and alumni are working to\
  \ understand and help us make progress toward a more sustainable and just world.\
  \ This core mission draws upon all of the fields represented at MIT: not just science,\
  \ engineering, and technology, but also the humanities, arts, economics, history,\
  \ architecture, urban planning, management, policy, and more.\n\nUse OCW materials\
  \ from across these fields to expand your horizons and learn more about our relationship\
  \ with the environment. The course list below is particularly inspired by two interdisciplinary\
  \ MIT programs. Many of the undergraduate courses fall within the [undergraduate\
  \ Environment and Sustainability Minor](http://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/environment-sustainability-minor/)\
  \ devised by MIT\u2019s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI). Many of the graduate-level\
  \ courses are part of the\_[MIT Sloan School of Management Sustainability Certificate](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate)\
  \ curriculum."
