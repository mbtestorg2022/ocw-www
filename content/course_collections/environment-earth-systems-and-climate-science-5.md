description: "Like so many of the big challenges taken on at MIT, environmental issues\
  \ demand an interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nFrom declining fisheries to acute\
  \ urban pollution to record-breaking global temperatures, the evidence of human\
  \ impact on the environment continues to mount. And at the same time, the environment\
  \ shapes us, as human society and institutions are built upon our connection to\
  \ the weather, land, water, and other species. What can we learn from ecological\
  \ systems and cycles? What are the right solutions to our urgent environmental challenges?\n\
  \nMIT scholars, students and alumni are working to understand and help us make progress\
  \ toward a more sustainable and just world. This core mission draws upon all of\
  \ the fields represented at MIT: not just science, engineering, and technology,\
  \ but also the humanities, arts, economics, history, architecture, urban planning,\
  \ management, policy, and more.\n\nUse OCW materials from across these fields to\
  \ expand your horizons and learn more about our relationship with the environment.\
  \ The course list below is particularly inspired by two interdisciplinary MIT programs.\
  \ Many of the undergraduate courses fall within the [undergraduate Environment and\
  \ Sustainability Minor](http://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/environment-sustainability-minor/)\
  \ devised by MIT\u2019s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI); the OCW course\
  \ list employs the undergraduate minor\u2019s four topic pillars. Many of the graduate-level\
  \ courses are part of the\_[MIT Sloan School of Management Sustainability Certificate](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate)\
  \ curriculum."
