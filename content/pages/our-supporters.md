## **Individual Supporters**

MIT OpenCourseWare is grateful to the [thousands of individuals](https://giving.mit.edu/recognition/) who support our work and are committed to knowledge as a public good. These donations enable us to continue to create MIT educational materials that broaden educational opportunities and change lives.

We also appreciate the learners who share with us the impact OCW has made in their lives:

*“When I was in high school I had close to a 4.0 GPA, and I had planned to go to college. Unfortunately tragedy struck when my father died one year before I would have graduated, and consequently I was not even able to finish high school (I later got a GED). After that happened, life got away from me, and the prospects of my going to college disappeared. Nearly ten years later, in spite of my busy schedule, I was finally able to learn Calculus I thanks to these great lectures and course materials that are online. I feel that **a previously closed door has been reopened to me.**” — Carl, USA*

*“I have a mental disorder, and I cannot study in a traditional university setting.**MIT OCW made it possible for me to follow university courses despite of my disorder.** I am really grateful for this. It gave me back some part of my life that I had not expected to experience anymore.” — Monika, Hungary*

*“It’s great having online courses available to every person from one of the best universities of the world. MIT has always been very focused towards its goal of providing education to all sections of the society and I hope this reaches bigger heights. I am currently going through Quantum Physics I (8.04) and Introduction to Computer Science (6.00SC). **My school doesn't provide any such courses or classes on these topics.** I always wanted to be a physicist and computer scientist. **And MIT OCW is helping me greatly achieve my goals in life.** Again, from my deepest sense of gratitude, I thank all of MIT for their years of teaching excellence.” — Satya, India*
