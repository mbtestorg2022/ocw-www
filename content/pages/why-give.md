Since our founding in 2001, MIT OpenCourseWare has been guided by a revolutionary mission to openly share educational resources from MIT with the world. The site presents the core academic content — including lecture notes, syllabi, assignments, and exams — from nearly all of MIT's undergraduate and graduate curricula. All content is offered freely and openly to support formal and informal learning around the world, whenever learners need them. Many of the site's 2,600+ courses also include rich media resources such as video lectures, faculty podcasts, and inspiring examples of student work. Over twenty years in, our commitment to deliver on this mission continues as we work on more accessible, collaborative, and resilient ways of sharing resources and knowledge for the future.

OCW has inspired a worldwide movement that now includes hundreds of universities sharing materials from more than ten thousand courses and has touched the lives of millions. Just as OCW would not be possible without the generosity of the MIT faculty sharing their course materials and methods, OCW would not be possible without the support of thousands of individuals who donate each year. Your gift ensures we can keep OCW growing with new courses and more of the rich resources — from video to podcasts — that make a difference for so many worldwide.

## **Why does MIT OpenCourseWare need my donation?**

MIT is committed to openly sharing course materials on OpenCourseWare, free of charge. While OCW is free for anyone to access and use, it is not without cost to maintain and publish MIT course content. Support from the Institute provides about half of OCW’s budget, and the remainder is provided by the generosity of learners like you, who donate to OCW with a median gift of $25. Gifts directly help OCW distribute, collect, digitize, and share resources from MIT faculty and courses. 

As we invest in new ways of reaching learners through video, social media, and podcasting, and the NextGen platform and program, a more modern OCW platform to better meet learners’ needs, donations to OCW are more important than ever in ensuring the sustainability of our work. Gifts also enable OCW to provide [local copies of the OCW site](https://ocw.mit.edu/about/mirror-site-program/?utm_source=ocw&utm_medium=&whygivepage&utm_campaign=textlink) to participating schools, universities, and organizations in bandwidth-constrained regions.  

Above all, your gift to OCW demonstrates a commitment to knowledge as a universal public good.

## **What does it take to run OCW?**

Each course we publish requires an average of 100 hours of effort to produce, and OCW typically publishes materials from 60 courses on our site each year. In addition to MIT faculty, behind OCW is a dedicated team of about 20 publication specialists, intellectual property managers, web and technical production managers, video editors, and administrators who work directly with faculty to collect and compile course materials, ensure proper licensing for open sharing, format materials for our site, and manage OCW’s communications, outreach, and operations. OCW sustains a considerable technical infrastructure to manage content and distribute it through a worldwide network to our global audience. Supporting rich media, such as our very popular video content, can be especially costly.
