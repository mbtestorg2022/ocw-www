Choosing a new career and starting over from square one takes courage. Many people may be intimidated by the daunting task of learning a new trade, but fortunately career-changers can find ample support in open educational resources like MIT OpenCourseWare.

Take the case of Trent Parker, a former chemistry PhD candidate and himself a creator of open educational resources. Parker wanted to get into software engineering, so he built a self-directed learning program on OCW courses, and with powerful new knowledge and skills soon landed a great job at Google.

Parker had been studying chemistry since his undergraduate days, and was a graduate student studying physical chemistry. Khan Academy’s free informal learning videos inspired him to start [TMP Chem](https://www.youtube.com/user/TMPChem), a YouTube channel for his niche field, thinking “there’s no reason every technical field shouldn’t have this.” He could clearly see the value of open education.

As TMP Chem gained followers, Parker also gained more private tutoring clients. These two pursuits became a substantial time commitment, leading to a critical moment. Although chemistry made up Parker’s entire academic career and skill set, he was unhappy with his progress toward the PhD. So he left his degree program in 2016, piecing together more private tutoring and developing a second version of his TMP Chem YouTube channel.

Yet Parker was hungry to make a bigger impact on the world, and find a more stable career. Software engineering seemed to fit the bill, and what better place than MIT to learn that subject?

Fortunately, OpenCourseWare has extensive course materials on [computer science](https://ocwnext.odl.mit.edu/search/?t=Computer%20Science), including a curated list of [introductory programming](https://ocwnext.odl.mit.edu/pages/introductory-programming/) starting points.
